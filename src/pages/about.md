Lemon Productions is a podcast studio based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan run by me – Chris Enns. Helping individuals and businesses get off the ground and onto the web is what drives me and why I love running my own business.

I published my first podcast in 2009 and with 2,000+ podcast episodes produced, recorded, edited, and published into the world since then, I’m just as excited about podcasting as when I started.

I love building getting to work in audio & video with clients. It’s come full circle to what I had hoped to do when I started Lemon Productions in 2006.

## Where You Can Find Me Online

I’m most active on Mastodon or [Threads](https://www.threads.com/@ichrisv2) on my personal accounts, but you can also find me [@LemonPodcasting on Threads](https://www.threads.com/@lemonpodcasting).

I post to Instagram @[LemonPodcasting](https://www.instagram.com/lemonpodcasting/), live stream [on my Twitch channel](https://www.lemonproductions.ca/live), and [have a YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/lemonproductionsca) full of Mac audio tips and tricks with over 1,000 subscribers.

I also write a weekly newsletter called [Life as a Lemon](https://buttondown.email/lemoncasting).

## Who I Work For

When you’re hiring Chris & Lemon Productions, it’s kind of like you’re hiring a team of 5. I don’t usually bring all of them to meetings, let my oldeset write proposals, or let my 2 youngest edit podcasts — but helping you succeed in whatever you’ve hired me to do means I get to transfer that success back to my family.

By choosing to work with me, you’re supporting a Saskatoon family. And we thank you for that.
